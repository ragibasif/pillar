# Make commands:
# `make`
# `make all`
# `make clean`

# Object files are compiled with the appropriate flags for each target.
#  Uses `-g` for debugging symbols, `-O2` for optimization, and `-DDEBUG` to enable debug-specific code. Enables all warnings (`-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`) and treats warnings as errors (`-Werror`).
# `-O3` for maximum optimization and `-DNDEBUG` to disable assertions.
# `all`: building the binary
# `clean`: Removes obj and bin files
#
# use tabs instead of spaces
